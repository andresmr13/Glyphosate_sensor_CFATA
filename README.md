# Glyphosate_sensor_CFATA
Documentation and code relevant to the glyphosate sensor project developed in CFATA. Core code here is intended to perform glyphosate concentration prediction based on light emission/dispersion data used as input in a MLP with the potential addition of attention mechanisms. The code here uses keras but is intended to migrate to PyTorch.
